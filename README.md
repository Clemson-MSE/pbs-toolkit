# PBS Toolkit

This repository contains several handy scripts for using an HPC cluster, specifically one that uses the PBS scheduler and Environment Modules (Tmod). These scripts include:

- Install scripts for creating environment modules for software packages
- Batch scripts for some basic operations (copy, chmod, etc)
- Utility scripts for monitoring PBS jobs, including CPU / memory / disk / GPU
